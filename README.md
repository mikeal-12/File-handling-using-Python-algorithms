## Project Description
At my organization(fictional), access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The <code>allow_list.txt</code> file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the <code>allow_list.txt</code> file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access.
